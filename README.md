- Hi, I’m Lucas José Pairetti Ribotta
i'm an systems engineering from Santa Fe, Argentina. 
i'm also an electrical mechanical technician but now I'm more inclined towards systems.
For the moment i normally study 3D modeling and sculpture in programs like Blender and Zbrush, i'm very interested in VR games so i'm learning about that
